# Tikky's Portfolio


Hey! Thanks for checking out my portfolio. This repository contains my solo projects I've worked whilst teaching myself SQL ansd data visualisation. Check out my first project on railway infrastructure and economic growth in the EU (visualisations on tableau)

# Projects
- **Railway Infrastructure and Economic Growth in the EU**: In this project, I used data from eurostat to produce summary statistics on the level of railway provision on 24 EU member states. I joined data from a macroeconomic dataset from the World Bank Organisation to provide further insights such as GDP growth, railway density, and railway per capita.
